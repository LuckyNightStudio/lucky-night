For most entrepreneurs and small business owners, decisions made around branding can feel very personal. These businesses have been built from the ground up usually completely alone (at least at first) so it can be difficult to separate brand from self. It can be all too easy to decide one day that we no longer like our logo or our colour scheme and decide a full rebrand is the next logical step.

Obviously, here at Lucky Night we bloody love a rebrand, and think it’s inevitable that all flourishing businesses will one day outgrow their homemade Canva branding and move on to bigger and better things. Maybe even a brand package from Lucky Night Studio!

Read through our list of 3 things that will ensure your rebrand is being done for the right reasons and will genuinely reap real benefits for your brand down the line. A simple logo change isn’t likely to see much in the way of positive results, but a strategic rethink of your audience, your positioning and your messaging (and then developing a new range of logos) definitely will.

## 1. Ask yourself why

As with all things in business, the big question is ‘why?’. Why do you want to rebrand - what are you hoping to achieve? Why do you think now is the right time? Why will it be useful for your business? 

If you can answer all these questions from your business’ perspective then it may indeed be an ideal time for you to take on this kind of project. For example, if you answered ‘I want this rebrand because I’d like to start attracting higher-paying clients and I feel my current visuals are holding me back’ rather than ‘I no longer like the shade of purple I used when I set it up’, then a rebrand could be great for you. If you answered ‘I think now would be a great time as it’s the quieter season for me and I like to be prepared for my next boom’ rather than ‘I don’t have any other projects on right now, so why not?’ then again - you’re thinking about things correctly from the perspective of your business and you’re likely perfectly set up for an effective rebrand.

## 2. Give yourself time to think

When we’re used to flying solo (or at least being the captain of the ship) it can be incredibly frustrating being told to wait when you feel you’ve had a brainwave. But rebrands are expensive and intense and time consuming and not a project to be taken up on a whim.

Hopefully you’ve now got a good idea of your ‘why’ and you’re able to properly assess whether or not your reasons are strategic enough to warrant the project. Before you go any further, you need to get crystal clear on your reasons why and give yourself time to think over outcomes you’d like to see, goals you’d like to hit and things you’d like to leave in the past. It’s also a great time to start auditing your businesses so you can get a good understanding of what things work for you, what don’t, who your favourite kind of customers are etc - these are great bits of information to take into a rebrand project!

## 3. Find the right designer

Once you understand your ‘whys’ and you’ve given yourself time to map out your objectives for the project, it’s time to think about who you’d actually like to do the work. Will you work with an agency or a freelancer? (there are incredibly talented people working in each discipline, it just depends what kind of workflow and level of structure you prefer) What values are important to you that you would like to see reflected in your designer? Will you look for someone with a specific design style or would you prefer an all-rounder? These are all valuable questions and deserve a bit of thought before you send any enquiries.

Some things not to do when deciding on a designer for your rebrand:

* **Don’t consider people based on price alone.** Yes, budget is an important factor and there’s no point sending an enquiry to Pentagram if you don’t have £££ to spend; but basing this decision on the lowest-price alone is a race to the bottom. There are plenty of young or inexperienced designers out there that would be willing to rebrand your business for £20, but will the work be good? Almost certainly not. Budget should be one factor, not the whole decision.
* **Don’t move forward with any designer/agency that leaves you feeling unimportant or unheard.** This is your business, and at project completion the work they create will belong to you. If at any point in the discovery phase you feel you’re being dismissed or overlooked, it’s ok (and right) to look elsewhere - even if they do work that you love. You’re far more likely to get a great result from a designer who really listens to and does their best to understand you, even if their usual design style isn’t 100% what you’re looking for.
* **Don’t jump on the first available creative.** We appreciate it can already feel like a long wait while you’ve been taking your time getting to know your ‘why’ and your goals, but accepting the soonest-available designer (unless they’re otherwise an amazing fit for you and you’ve just had a wonderful stroke of luck!) can be a recipe for disaster. As entrepreneurs, our desire to get projects moving forward can cloud our judgement, so make sure you’re choosing your designer for their work and aligned values, not just their open schedule!
