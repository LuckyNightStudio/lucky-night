### **Set a realistic deadline**

Setting up a website is so important that the pressure of having it completed as soon as humanly possible can overwhelm even the most organised of small biz owners. But it’s important not to rush something as important as your website, and instead set yourself a realistic, achievable deadline to create effective content and plan a perfect user journey before you even get started on design and build.

Far better to set up a holding page with a contact link and option to sign up to your email list while you get yourself organised and ready to launch a well thought out site. Our turnaround time for a website is 4 weeks minimum - you’d be amazed how many solo business owners try to do it in a week - and that’s trying to do everything themselves!

> Give yourself time to research, plan and execute properly, you’ll thank yourself later.

### **Get your content on point**

Good website content needs to focus not on what you do, but the problems that you solve for your customers. Get to know your customers (or who you want your customers to be) and learn about the ways your product or service makes their life easier and lead all of your content with that information.

> Instead of saying ‘we design sales websites for small businesses’ try saying ‘we help overwhelmed business owners get more sales without the hard work through sales-focussed websites’. Can you see how that lays out their user’s problems (overwhelmed, hard to get sales) and provides a solution (sales-focussed websites) by focussing the customer as the main character of their content.

Make sure you give your customers plenty of opportunities to buy, and answer as many questions or objections as you can in your copy (this is where great customer research and solid strategy really comes in handy).

### **Warm up your audience**

Picture this: you’ve spent 3 months working tirelessly on your website. You understand your ideal customer, your content is solid and you’re finally happy with the design. You launch, eagerly awaiting all the sales and enquiries that are sure to come from your perfect new website! But instead…crickets.

So what’s happened here? You haven’t properly primed your audience! The weeks you are building your site, you should also be hyping up your customers to expect something new and exciting (you can do this via social media or email campaigns).

> Rather than launching completely cold, give your audience sneak peeks, let them know what to expect, talk regularly about all the ways your website will help them solve their problems and the solutions you’re ready to offer them.

You could even run a competition or countdown to coincide with your launch to up the energy - just make sure your customers actually know that you’re launching!

### **Lay your SEO foundations**

It’s no secret that a good website ranking takes a bit of time. You’ll need to create regular new content like blogs and testimonials, set up backlinks and generate traffic in order to boost your ranking. But it’s crucial to ensure solid SEO foundations are laid at website creation stage.

> You can lay the right foundations for Google and other search engines by ensuring your content is well-written and focussed around your area of expertise.

Try not to duplicate content as this can damage your score. Also ensure all images are appropriately sized and use descriptive file names and alt text.

### **Test your site like crazy**

Before you even consider launching your shiny new website to your expectant and eager audience, you’ve gotta test, test and test some more. Go through every page of your website with a fine tooth comb, looking for any issues with the design or build. Then do it again in as many different browsers as you can (Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox etc). Then, do it al again on as many different devices as you can. Use your smartphone, borrow your mums older smartphone, check it on an iPad or tablet, have a look on your Kindle - anywhere that your site may potentially be displayed.

> We recommend testing on as many different smartphones as possible. They account for over half of web traffic these days and come in so many different shapes and sizes it’s important that all of your content is visible, buttons are clickable and any modals or forms work as expected.

### **Have a launch day plan**

If you’ve followed all the advice above, it’s unlikely that you’ll encounter any catastrophic issues come launch day. However, shit happens and it’s always best to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.

If you’ve used a tech or development team, make sure they’re aware of when you’re launching and try to plan it around them so that they can be on hand to help if necessary. Don’t announce your site launch until you’re 100% sure that it’s up and running as expected, and make sure to always have a backup of your site and content just in case.
