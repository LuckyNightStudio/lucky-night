### **Set a realistic deadline**

Setting up a website is so important that the pressure of having it completed as soon as humanly possible can overwhelm even the most organised of small biz owners. But it’s important not to rush something as important as your website, and instead set yourself a realistic, achievable deadline to create effective content and plan a perfect user journey before you even get started on design and build.

Far better to set up a holding page with a contact link and option to sign up to your email list while you get yourself organised and ready to launch a well thought out site. Our turnaround time for a website is 4 weeks minimum - you’d be amazed how many solo business owners try to do it in a week - and that’s trying to do everything themselves!

> Give yourself time to research, plan and execute properly, you’ll thank yourself later.

### **Get your content on point**

Good website content needs to focus not on what you do, but the problems that you solve for your customers. Get to know your customers (or who you want your customers to be) and learn about the ways your product or service makes their life easier and lead all of your content with that information.

> Instead of saying ‘we design sales websites for small businesses’ try saying ‘we help overwhelmed business owners get more sales without the hard work through sales-focussed websites’. Can you see how that lays out their user’s problems (overwhelmed, hard to get sales) and provides a solution (sales-focussed websites) by focussing the customer as the main character of their content.

Make sure you give your customers plenty of opportunities to buy, and answer as many questions or objections as you can in your copy (this is where great customer research and solid strategy really comes in handy).
